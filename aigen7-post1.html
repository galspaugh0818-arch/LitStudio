  <article class="post-body">
        <p>Generative painting models have exploded into public awareness. Fans praise their speed, while critics ask who really receives credit. This article explores the boundary between inspiration and appropriation, and suggests practical steps artists and platforms can take to preserve creative agency.</p>
        <h3>Origins and training data</h3>
        <p>The models learn patterns from huge datasets scraped across the web. This collective memory provides a palette of forms, but it also carries the fingerprints of individual artists whose work was used as training material.</p>
        <h3>Creative workflows</h3>
        <p>Used responsibly, these tools increase iteration speed and lower technical barriers. Workshops combining human sketching with model-assisted color studies produce some of the strongest outcomes.</p>
